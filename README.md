DotNet Hints
============

This is a personal collection of code snippets and hints that reminds me how to do things in dotnet. The end game being that I do not have to commit these trivia to memory thereby causing me to forget anniversaries and birthdays.

The assumption is that the reader is a knowledgeable programmer. As such, the code snippets reflect the core way something is done favoring clarity through brevity over production worthy correctness.

Enjoy!
